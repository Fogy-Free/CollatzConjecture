<h1>Collatz Conjecture</h1>
<p>Collatz conjecture in mathematics states that
    if you start with any positive integer
    and repeatedly apply the following two rules,
    you will eventually reach 1:
    If the number is even, divide it by 2.
    If the number is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1.
    As you can see, the sequence eventually reaches 1,
    no matter what the starting number is.
    The Collatz conjecture states that this will always happen,
    no matter what positive integer you start with.
    The Collatz conjecture is one of the most famous unsolved
    problems in mathematics. It has been studied by mathematicians
    for over a century, but no one has been able to prove or disprove it.
    Also, it is the math equation on the students door in Wakanda forever.</p>
<p>Enter a number to see how many steps it takes with the Collatz conjecture.</p>
<p>This is the java ternary example of the Collatz conjecture.</p>
<p>next = (N % 2 == 0) ? (N/2) : (3*N+1);</p>
